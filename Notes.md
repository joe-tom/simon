#Programming Notes
### Initial Comments
I'm an experienced JS developer so I got a little bored doing the challenge task. That being said, I found fun in obfuscating and hiding my code as well as changing up the design a bit. See if you can figure out how the code works! If you can't, or if you have but can't understand it, as it's minified and compiled check the link at the bottom for a fully commented version.

Additionally, it was a bit unclear as to what browser this is to run on, and whether or not external libraries and frameworks are allowed. As such, I assumed this was to be run on the most recent browser and external code would not be allowed.

If you look at my code you will notice that I tried to make use of as many new array prototype functions as possible. Generally in JS interviews they'd like to see the use of .bind .call and .apply.


### Problems and Hardships
Obviously animations in vanillaJS are a pain, so that was probably the most difficult part of the whole thing.

### Plans for the Future
I got busy so there were a couple things that I was planning on doing but didn't bother with in the end.  Here they are:

- Multiplayer Simon using WebRTC. (Obviously this requires a server for signaling but luckily the nice people who created the PeerJS library provide a free one).
- Simon using some sort of [randomness test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness_tests) to add to scoring. Right now it just adds the product of the number of notes and some constant.
